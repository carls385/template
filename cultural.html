			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>	 Film maker Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s 2012 movie Django Unchained is a prime example of a modern film filled with outrageous scenes of graphic violence.  This film, a winner of two academy awards, is projecting ideas of extreme violence to its audience and causing an impact of creating an increasingly violent society.  The violent themes can be directly linked to influencing violent crimes and actions in society and is very damaging to society as a whole.  The film, though extreme violence is a very large aspect and social issue itself, also causes another controversy in the United States.  Set in the Lincoln Era of the United States, this film unearths topics of African American slavery and depicts them in a shockingly brutal way.  The film can be causing unintended tension between white Americans and black Americans as it depicts slavery in a way never seen before.  To help combat these controversial and adverse themes influencing society there should be an increase in censorship for major motion pictures being released.  </p>
