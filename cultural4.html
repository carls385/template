			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>	Gun violence is largely prevalent in todayâ€™s society and regulation laws are constantly being analyzed and revised.  As acts of mass shootings such as Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Arora Colorado, seem to be occurring more frequently than ever before, it is evident that something new is motivating them.  Django Unchained and movies alike can be to blame.  When a person is subject to the corrupt view on violence that is shown in these movies they become more apt to act out in a similar manner.  Young people, in their developmental ages, are especially prone to this influence and it is clear that they are the majority committing these acts.  Mass school shootings are common across the country and most are acted out by students that attend the institution.  As violent acts sweep across the country, guns are to blame, and it has become a regular debate among government and citizens alike.</p>
	<p></p>Acts of violence like mass shootings do not cause problems with just those involved, and some acts may impact that entire country in just one moment.  Presidential assassinations and acts of terror are also plaguing our society.  The bombing of the Boston Marathon is an issue that caused nationwide distress and the shutdown of almost an entire major city.  These acts can be linked to the violence nature being ingrained in our society by Django and movies alike.</p> 
	<p></p>The United States has been fighting a long battle with racism, especially between black and white American.  Luckily the battle is winning and states across the country have made huge leaps towards creating a country where everyone can get along no matter their race. Even as improvements seem to be everywhere there are still issues.  The United States won the war against slavery but tensions still arise between the blacks and the whites.  Whether it is bitterness for the oppression of the African Americans or the belief that one race is better than the other, these topics are rekindled in Django.  The renowned Ku Klux Klan is in very small numbers today and still on the decline but, members still exists and their ideals are the same, continuing to cause racial tension.  Such groups may find influence in Django, where the group is shown as powerful, large, and violent.
