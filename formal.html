			<h1>Literacy and Business</h1>
			<p>	Ask any elementary school student what the most important class of the day is and most will answer, “Recess.”  Arguably it is, but there are other important fundamental skills taught early on as well.  Reading and writing are fundamental skills taught early-on to children all over the world.  These skills are used so frequently day-in and day-out that they may be taken for granted.  It is necessary to recognize the importance that reading and writing hold when entering upper-level education.  These skills are necessary for effective communication, learning, and research, whether it is technological or rhetorical.  When entering higher education, and a specific academic discipline of choice, it is essential to realize the expectations for reading, writing, and researching, to ensure success not only in courses but, once working in the field.  Business, though a discipline largely overlooked when thinking about reading or writing, actually requires a mastering of these skills.  </p>
			<p>Reading is the most important of the three skills, not only in business, but in life.  Maria Gistinger is a teacher of college writing classes at Walsh College, a business college in Michigan.  She stated that, “The expectations that a professor of incoming college students has regarding their students’ reading skills are that students should be reading at grade level.” (Gistinger).  Reading at grade level for college students means that students are able to read complex text and pull meaningful information from it at a level appropriate for their age group.  Developing strong reading skills begins when a child is young.  There are arguments made for and against social promotion of elementary students through grade level.  Social promotion means that despite the student’s ability to comprehend grade level material, they are promoted to the next grade level based on their age, not their ability.  Inner city schools are more responsible for this action than other schools.  Students that are exposed to this are unable to grasp grade appropriate material but are promoted to the next level despite lack of overall academic ability, not just reading ability.  These students will end up struggling all throughout the rest of their academic and professional careers.  Some students even enact legal proceedings against their schools.  </p><img src="http://www.gemmlearning.com/images/reading-skills-pyramid-basic.PNG">
			<p>(Fig. 1.  A diagram that illustrates steps and processes to reach reading proficiency.  "Online Reading Programs." By Gemm Learning. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Mar. 2014. <http://www.gemmlearning.com/online-reading-programs.php>.)</p>
			<p>It is vital that anyone interested in business grasps reading skills early on.  Business and reading are intertwined and reading more as a young child will help increase proficiency.  Being read to as a youngster can cause a more curious intellect and develop lifelong learners. Even reading short fictional stories as a child can be a useful early start.  “It seems that reading fiction improves your sensitivity to and appreciation of complex human situations; it provides a richer ‘toolkit’ of understanding from which to pull when making decisions and building relationships.  And as our business lives get more complex, faster-paced, less hierarchical and more dependent upon our ability to build support with those around us – that kind of toolkit becomes ever more critical to our success” (Anderson).  While most children from earlier generations read or were read to on a regular basis, today children spend more time with digital devices than with a book.  College professors are now assigning readings that are above the ability of students, not because the professor is mean, but because there is a reading deficit among the students.  Reading more or even being read to will increase success in the business discipline. </p> 
	<p>Becoming a stronger reader is as simple as just practicing.  There are steps to follow to quickly become a more effective reader (see figure 1).  After a couple of years of being exposed to college level texts, diligent students will rise to expectations and be able to process the given material.  That is not to say that weak readers will struggle in the beginning.  Students first starting off will have to read the same page over and over again, often with a dictionary, until it is comprehended.  The expectations for reading level of a college freshman to a college senior are not that different so it is helpful to develop reading skills before entering the business discipline to stay ahead of the game.   
</p>
<p>Writing is the other essential skill for business students.  When asked about the expectations of students in college and their writing skills Gistinger replied that, “beginning college students should possess the ability to write comprehensibly with more style and sophistication than one would expect from the basic high school paper that contains a thesis, a body, and a conclusion.” (Gistinger).  Writing is an area that is almost becoming a lost art.  As the digital age continues to advance students are able to communicate with peers and others using short texts that are so brief that it has created a literacy almost all its own.  Despite the words and sentences being different from a written message, the subject is still being communicated effectively.  Students that were fortunate enough to attend schools that focused on developing basic writing skills continue to develop strong writing skills as college students. Students that were not as fortunate may find themselves in remedial writing classes or being weeded out of business colleges all together because they have such a lack of writing skill they perform too poorly. It cannot be stressed enough how important writing is to college business students.  </p>
<p>Colleges are now finding it necessary to change whole curriculums due to the gap students have in their knowledge of professional writing:
	Walsh College has developed a writing class because students were graduating and 	entering the business world without the ability to write properly.  The college assumed 	that writing was part of every student’s academic background but, that proved to not be 	the case.  It was determined that it was easy to matriculate through a business program 	which focuses mainly on numbers without ever having to write a business paper.  Even		 some of the college’s top scholars were poor writers.  There are currently three teachers		 of the business writing class at Walsh and they tend to see a wide gap in the ability of 		students.  The mandatory course sees students that are so proficient that they do not even 	require the course and others that struggle greatly.  The good writers tend to point to their 	high school English teachers for their ability to write so well.  Most students do benefit 	from the course. (Gistinger)This is an explanation of how colleges and universities are preparing to adapt to incoming students that are not learning adequate writing skills due to poor prior schooling and an ever changing technological world.  Colleges are not willing to wait very long for their students to learn these writing skills because they should, in theory, already be mastered before the students arrive at the school.  Students are expected to master the skills in one semester.  Students benefit from classes like this one in future courses and in the business world.

<p>In a discipline that seems widely involved with numbers and not writing it may seem strange that colleges are creating new and required courses to teach students how to write but, these skills are essential for working.  A scholarly article published by Lynchburg College was used as a research resource.  “Communicating with others is essential in every career, not only in business. A manager could have the best ideas in the world, but if he or she is not able to communicate these ideas to others, the ideas are of no practical use to anyone. It is a commonly believed myth among business students that writing skills are not of utmost importance; however, it is through writing that one is able to communicate with others. Whether it is through memos, e-mails, reports, or letters, business people use some form of writing each and every day.”  (Writing in Business and Economics).  When employers are looking to hire a new recruit, they expect that the recruit can communicate effectively.  Reading and writing come into play with this type of effective communication, whether it is by writing a memo, a letter or an email to a client, or presenting to their peers.  Due to employers finding a lot of applicants are coming in with terrible reading and writing skills, they are now asking for writing samples.  If a person cannot write adequately as a college graduate, it is very unlikely that their skills will develop any further once they are in the work world.  In essence, entering an academic discipline with efficient knowledge in reading and writing in order to succeed and receive a degree is imperative to impressing employers and getting hired (see figure 2).  </p>
<p>Expectations for students and research in the business discipline will vary depending on the college or university attended.  Some universities, like Michigan State University for example, are research institutes and it may be more likely that students can participate in research.   On the other side of things, it is likely that many students in business will not be required to conduct research.  Gistinger does not only teach business writing at Walsh but she is also one of the few faculty members that conduct research as well.  As a PhD professor she is required to create and release at least three scholarly articles every five years.  Therefore, due to this special circumstance, Gistinger must conduct research in the given field she wishes to write about.  </p>
<p>In the same interview with Maria Gistinger mentioned earlier, when asked about research and business she mentioned, “Unless your employer is a university and you are a college professor, employees are not required to conduct or possess the knowledge to conduct business research.  I believe that the business industry relies on the current field of research developed by academicians to produce the information required to understand the topic that is being researched, if at all.  When I think of business research, I refer to research that is conducted by trained academicians that produce results that are then utilized by the specific industry.” (Gistinger).  Research is minimal if entering the business work force and not seeking a career as a scholar.  </p>
<p>An ordinary employee in the business industry is not required to conduct research and present it like they would if they were academics required to produce publications.  Industry-specific problems may occur and to solve them teams of employees are required to find ways to solve them through researching that industry but, this research is more like a project.  Business, like a number of other disciplines, has a general divide between those that practice in the field and those that research and typically that divide is never crossed.   As for students coming fresh out of graduation and beginning the job search, expectations of employers for their employees and the ability to conduct research is not crucial.  The skill of business researching will only be important to employers if the employee is expected to perform research in everyday duties.  Such an example in business would be a tax researcher.  Outside of that, employers will not see much value in employees possessing the knowledge to perform research.  The largest amount of research done in the business by students would be done in the classroom.  Such research would simply be typical research done by any student at the given college or university that is necessary to complete ordinary writing, reading, or other course assignments.  </p>
<p>In short, the business world, and the world as a whole, depends on people who are able to read, write, and conduct research.  All of these skills depend on one another.  With research you must be able to read to learn and write to record findings.  Reading is then required for the viewer to interpret the findings.  These skills are equally as important for not only succeeding in the classroom to earn a degree and acquire a job but, also once on the job.  Reading and writing are crucial when communicating in the business world with a boss or other co-workers whether it is done technologically or rhetorically.  Employers are looking for well-rounded students with the ability to read and write effectively.  Due to an ever-changing technological world, skills such as writing are changing and seen as obsolete by newer generations but, these skills are still required to get a job.  Entering an academic discipline with adequate skills in reading and writing and understanding how research is conducted and used is imperative to get ahead and succeed, not only in education, but in the world altogether.  </p>
