			<h1>Literacy and Business</h1>
			<p>Ask any elementary school student what the most important class of the day is and most will answer, “Recess.”  Arguably it is, but there are other important fundamental skills taught early on as well.  Reading and writing are fundamental skills taught early-on to children all over the world.  These skills are used so frequently day-in and day-out that they may be taken for granted.  It is necessary to recognize the importance that reading and writing hold when entering upper-level education.  These skills are necessary for effective communication, learning, and research, whether it is technological or rhetorical.  When entering higher education, and a specific academic discipline of choice, it is essential to realize the expectations for reading, writing, and researching, to ensure success not only in courses but, once working in the field.  Business, though a discipline largely overlooked when thinking about reading or writing, actually requires a mastering of these skills.  </p>
			<p>Reading is the most important of the three skills, not only in business, but in life.  Maria Gistinger is a teacher of college writing classes at Walsh College, a business college in Michigan.  She stated that, “The expectations that a professor of incoming college students has regarding their students’ reading skills are that students should be reading at grade level.” (Gistinger).  Reading at grade level for college students means that students are able to read complex text and pull meaningful information from it at a level appropriate for their age group.  Developing strong reading skills begins when a child is young.  There are arguments made for and against social promotion of elementary students through grade level.  Social promotion means that despite the student’s ability to comprehend grade level material, they are promoted to the next grade level based on their age, not their ability.  Inner city schools are more responsible for this action than other schools.  Students that are exposed to this are unable to grasp grade appropriate material but are promoted to the next level despite lack of overall academic ability, not just reading ability.  These students will end up struggling all throughout the rest of their academic and professional careers.  Some students even enact legal proceedings against their schools.  </p><img src="image1.png">
