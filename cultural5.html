			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>	The line between good entertainment and extensively violent and harmful movies may be very hard to see but, something must be done to prevent harmful movies being exposed to masses of society.  The most effective way to do such a thing would be to increase censorship of major motion pictures.  A large leader that could effectively enact such a change would be the Motion Picture Association of America.  Current regulations should be improved to prevent movies from over glamorizing violence, sex, or drug use.  Major producers can play a large role in this by reviewing film proposals and not allowing such controversial themes to be used.  The idea of a movie is to entertain the audience and they can effectively do this without having to use a shock value.  Extremely expressive and artistic films can be kept in the underground scene where they are not as accessible as an Academy Award winner.  The word of the viewer may also play a large role as well.  Critics should concentrate efforts on labeling movies as harmful or too extreme in order to prevent viewers from going to see it. Films must undergo a revision with stricter censorship before being released in order to ensure that they are safe and friendly for all viewers.  </p>
