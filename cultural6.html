			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>	With an improved code for movie censoring, the Motion Pictures Association of America could have a powerful control over the types of movies being released.  Such a decrease in movies with controversial content and extreme violence would have very positive impacts on society.  The issue of racism could have an easier time dissipating as it is not revisited and rekindled by offensive films.  This would help the United States become a safer and more peaceful country where everyone does truly live equally.  </p>
<p></p>An important change with such an improvement in movie censorship would be the decline of violent acts.  As major motion pictures being release depict none or much tamer gun violence, violent acts that have shaken the nation will hopefully become scarce.  Viewers would not be subject to a film that glamorizes a hero slaughtering his enemies or an evil villain taking thousands of innocent lives.  As this happens, acts around the country would decrease.  If violent acts are no longer an issue, gun laws may also see a change in debate as less and less people feel the need to protect themselves from others.
