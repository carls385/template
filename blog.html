	        <p>After viewing the video presented on Youtube it can be inferred that the purpose was to explain to the audience the life stories of the author of his uncle and that the struggle they both experienced can have different outcomes.  The uncle of the author was a homosexual who eventually committed suicide to because he was rejected by his family.  The author is in the same position as his uncle was before him but, he wants to explain to the audience, possibly people in the very same position as well, that it is possible to thrive because things do get better.  The video attempts this by sharing the tragic story of the uncle and his demise and contrasting it with a heartfelt letter that the author wrote to his deceased uncle.  The letter accomplishes it goal by explaining the struggle faced, the ways to overcome challenges, an optimistic view that things will get better, and the negative impact on the world left behind when committing suicide.  The message is a personal narrative in the form of a letter.  This structure is very similar to what the upcoming project is supposed to be so this will be very helpful when completing the project.  It shows how personal content is necessary including opinions and anecdotes.  I now know that these things must be included in my project.  </p>

		<p>In the video viewed on line of an episode of the television show South Park, the young characters are seen abandoning all normal life aspects including the use of bathrooms, socialization, going outdoors, and eating regular meals to play an online videogame.  The video seems to be aimed towards a group of people that includes the obese, the young, and anyone involved with online gaming.  The social issue at hand may be the impact that technology, videogames in specific, has on society.  The video portrays how videogames may affect the youth.   The issue may be the way that technology has made society less social in traditional ways because socialization online can replace regular face-to-face interaction.  Videogames may also cause a withdrawal from the outside world, a decrease in physical activity, and introduce a poorer diet.  The creators obviously believe that videogames are causing these adverse effects to the players.  The games can be enjoyed in moderation but, should not consume one’s life and normal human habits should be maintained as the games are not reality. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
		<p>The most prominent aspect of the advertisement’s effectiveness is the imagery.  Since the ad is a video I, as a viewer, had my focus drawn to the images in front of me the entire time.  Even as there was music and narration I found myself concentrating on the images before me.  Eminem can be seen driving a formal looking Chrysler 200 through the dark and rainy streets of Detroit.  Even though the scenery is not ideal, dark and rainy, it evokes an emotive quality that goes with the overall theme of the video.  The imagery is mysterious but powerful and creates a mystique for the vehicle and the city that is appealing to a possible consumer.  The narration and the music also come into play in supporting the overall theme of the ad.  As the instrumental of “Lose Yourself” plays triumphantly behind a man’s voice describing Detroit as a city crafted from the “hottest fires that make the hottest steal” and other powerful quotes that describe how Detroit is, and has been, the best place to buy a car.  The narrator draws pride from the hearts of any locals and makes others from outside the city obtain a sense of respect and pride for a city that has always had “hard work and conviction.”  Using Eminem as the face of the commercial again evokes more pride for Detroiters and others from outside the city as he is a success story from the city itself.  His music is also powerful and emotive, drawing an even greater sense of compassion for the city where Chrysler is made.   Together, these three aspects make the car very appealing to viewers, or consumers, because of how it portrays the city it comes from.  </p>
