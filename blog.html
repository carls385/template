	        <p>After viewing the video presented on Youtube it can be inferred that the purpose was to explain to the audience the life stories of the author of his uncle and that the struggle they both experienced can have different outcomes.  The uncle of the author was a homosexual who eventually committed suicide to because he was rejected by his family.  The author is in the same position as his uncle was before him but, he wants to explain to the audience, possibly people in the very same position as well, that it is possible to thrive because things do get better.  The video attempts this by sharing the tragic story of the uncle and his demise and contrasting it with a heartfelt letter that the author wrote to his deceased uncle.  The letter accomplishes it goal by explaining the struggle faced, the ways to overcome challenges, an optimistic view that things will get better, and the negative impact on the world left behind when committing suicide.  The message is a personal narrative in the form of a letter.  This structure is very similar to what the upcoming project is supposed to be so this will be very helpful when completing the project.  It shows how personal content is necessary including opinions and anecdotes.  I now know that these things must be included in my project.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 2 (inclass act.)</h1>
		<p>In the video viewed on line of an episode of the television show South Park, the young characters are seen abandoning all normal life aspects including the use of bathrooms, socialization, going outdoors, and eating regular meals to play an online videogame.  The video seems to be aimed towards a group of people that includes the obese, the young, and anyone involved with online gaming.  The social issue at hand may be the impact that technology, videogames in specific, has on society.  The video portrays how videogames may affect the youth.   The issue may be the way that technology has made society less social in traditional ways because socialization online can replace regular face-to-face interaction.  Videogames may also cause a withdrawal from the outside world, a decrease in physical activity, and introduce a poorer diet.  The creators obviously believe that videogames are causing these adverse effects to the players.  The games can be enjoyed in moderation but, should not consume one’s life and normal human habits should be maintained as the games are not reality. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 3 (inclass act.)</h1>
		<p>The most prominent aspect of the advertisement’s effectiveness is the imagery.  Since the ad is a video I, as a viewer, had my focus drawn to the images in front of me the entire time.  Even as there was music and narration I found myself concentrating on the images before me.  Eminem can be seen driving a formal looking Chrysler 200 through the dark and rainy streets of Detroit.  Even though the scenery is not ideal, dark and rainy, it evokes an emotive quality that goes with the overall theme of the video.  The imagery is mysterious but powerful and creates a mystique for the vehicle and the city that is appealing to a possible consumer.  The narration and the music also come into play in supporting the overall theme of the ad.  As the instrumental of “Lose Yourself” plays triumphantly behind a man’s voice describing Detroit as a city crafted from the “hottest fires that make the hottest steal” and other powerful quotes that describe how Detroit is, and has been, the best place to buy a car.  The narrator draws pride from the hearts of any locals and makes others from outside the city obtain a sense of respect and pride for a city that has always had “hard work and conviction.”  Using Eminem as the face of the commercial again evokes more pride for Detroiters and others from outside the city as he is a success story from the city itself.  His music is also powerful and emotive, drawing an even greater sense of compassion for the city where Chrysler is made.   Together, these three aspects make the car very appealing to viewers, or consumers, because of how it portrays the city it comes from.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
		<p>Toady was the day that the class’s first project was submitted.  The project due was the lived experience project.  The lived experience was a project designed for students to describe a piece of technology in our world and how that technology influenced our choice to major in our specified major.  The lived experience required a description of the technology and of the major that we have chosen.  I am majoring in engineering and this project was a great way to introduce myself more into my own major and discover possibly what made me decide that I want to be an engineer.  I described the computer and how that affected my choice to do engineering.  I also continued work on the codecademy website.  Coding is pretty fun and straightforward, which I like.  Before I started using codecademy I was pretty intimidated by coding and thought it was the most complicated thing in the world.  After getting my hands on some actual coding exercises I have found that it aint so bad.  It can be really rewarding to work on coding and see all these small pieces go together to form a nice looking web page.  As you code, it seems like you aren’t really getting there, but then clicking that link and visiting the page reveals the magic that you have been working on and it is really nice.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
		<p>Cultural analysis is being drafted and I am still having some trouble on this project.  The  fact that a draft is due and there is a deadline is actually quite helpful.  I have been pretty stuck on this and finding an artifact and discovering what it has done to society is tough.  I think it is hard to determine what impact an artifact has and what society has done.  I am also trying to find a relevant artifact for me to write about.  It is between violence in movies and videogames or how popular culture music has really been glamorizing sex, drugs, and violence in their lyrics and videos.  I am starting my draft and I think that I will discuss the violence in todays society after watching the movie Django Unchained, it seems pretty relevant.  I have continued codecademy with little trouble.  </p>
		<h1>BLog Entry 6</h1>
		<p>Cultural analysis writing has been going well.  I have decided a topic and am really feeling like it is a good one.  Writing this project is enjoying for me because it is an issue that I actually feel is relevant to my life.  with acts of violence being commited everyday and being publicized in the news frequently, society is moving towards a sort of unacceptable violence that affects many.  I am using the movie Django Unchained by Quentin Tarrantino and using it to compare and contrast the themes and nature of the film and the violence that we all see in real life.  It does seem that movies such as Django may be having an impact on viewers for the worse.  Heroes are seen using gratuitous violence for means of completing their goals and by glamorizing the actions of a hero, even though they may be unjust, the movie may be motivating members of our society to perform similar acts.  The acts are motivated by what is seen because the hero did the same.  A person may feel that this is how problems are solved, and they may be seen the same way as the hero in the movie if they commit violent acts.  Coding is still going well as well. I have been able to tackle a few more sections this week and it was a breeze.  Codecademy is fundamental and easy to understand.  I feel like I am well on my way to becoming a webmaster.</p>

		<p>The formal research project has been assigned.  It was introduced during class and I am feeling a bit intimidated.  The writing is getting exhausting and I also have a lot to do in my other classes.  I am going to discuss business and not engineering because I already wrote one assignment on engineering and I am not certain that I am going to stay with engineering in the future.  My family has a long line of accountants starting with my great grandfather who was an honest accountant.  My father before me and my brother are also both accountants so it runs in the blood.  This being said, I will formally research business and see where it takes me.  Scheduling in an interview may be tough.  I have break coming up and talking to a professor could be impossible over break.  Luckily my dad works as an accountant so he may have some hook ups for me to use as an interview.  Conducting an interview and writing a long paper will be tough the next couple of weeks.  We have turned in an annotated bibliography.  Turning in the annotated bibliography was a good exercise for me because it got some research stirring and introduced me to some good sources.  I used the lib docs that was shown in class and now have scholarly and trade articles.  A scholarly article is obviously something scholarly and technical while a trade article is something derived to appeal to the masses.  It is easy and accessible.  Trade articles come in the form of an entertaining piece such as a magazine or a comic.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 8</h1>
		<p>Formal research project drafting activity has been completed.  The draft act required us to propose a draft and throw down what ideas we have in a guided format.  These draft acts are nice for when it comes time to put together a final draft because the projects are formatted and some information has been put down.  After writing the rest of your paper, whats left is just piecing together the pieces and making a final draft.  I have been continuing to read articles on line and search for important information.  I think that a lot of information will be provided by the interviews that I will conduct.  I have also been searching for something that I can use as a source images in my project.  I think that some figures about Business Colleges and reading or writing skills amongst students will be useful.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 9</h1>
		<p>Over break I conducted an online interview with a professor and accountant.  The woman I interviewed works at Walsh College and she is a writing professor that instructs a course much like WRA 110.  She was an excellent source for information and I am very thankful that she was gracious enough to share her time with me.  Performing an interview via email was much more relaxed than going and conducting an interview face to face.  I was quite anxious about having to interview a professor face to face because it was more intimidating and intimate.  Performing the interview via email led for the interviewee to have a lot more time to prepare and gather information, better answering my questions and therefore being a better source.  I am ready to write this paper and throw it all together but, I am enjoying my break and I will wait until I am back in school to commence writing again.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 10</h1>
		<p>Formal research project is due this week.  I enjoyed break and now I am getting back into the spring of things.  I don’t really feel like writing the formal research paper anymore but I have to get back to it.  it is a long paper and I have a lot of information to tie together and write down.  Having a lot of information is better than not having any though so it is prepared to be completed.  I conducted a lot of research and this project has broadened my horizons.  Writng a research paper is a serious thing in upper level education and expectations are of course much higher than those in high school.  The analyzing and research must be thorough, constructive, evident, and relevant.  Drawing information from an interview is also something I have never done before.  Using an interview as a source for research was inevitably very helpful and I would love to use this as a source again in the future.  The formal remix project has been introduced.  The formal research is going to be a nice break from all of the writng that we have been doing but I still am not excited.  I think it is weird how much class has been cancelled.  The remix project could be hard to complete if class sessions are not held, considering that we only meet once a week as a class, it is crucial that this time is utilized effectively when in reach of the professor but, it hasn’t been.  Anyway, we watched a documentary in class and completed a worksheet which didn’t help me out too much with getting somewhere on the remix project. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 11</h1>
		<p>In class we were able to meet in groups and discuss the project that was to be completed.  Meeting in groups during class is very nice because that is time dedicated to wra work and im glad that it hasn’t been wasted.  With a hybrid online and off line class, it’s important that we can meet when scheduled, because we should.  My group met together in class and we all discussed what we want to do in order to complete the project and what will be the most effective model for completion.  The multimedia project is a project that requires us to take a past project and trans mediate that project into a new project that has a different form.  In essence you are to take an old report that was written for the wra class and turn it into a video which amplifies the effectiveness of the paper.  This will effectively cause a paper to come to life and reach an audience in a quicker and easier way.  We are drafting an outline of our plan of completion.    I do not have any experience with film making or anything to do with it.  I think it will be tough and it’s weird that we are making a video in a writing class.  It seems like a polar opposite of what we should actually be doing but, I guess I don’t have much of a choice.  Hopefully the documentary turns out alright.  The expectations presented in class sounded pretty high for a bunch of first year college students with little to no experience in video recording, editing, or directing.   I heard about other wra classes and there was a lot more room for creativity for this project rather than a rigid design.  I think that that would have been a lot more enjoyable.  If I wanted to make movies I would be making movies and studying that. I am here to learn writing.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 12</h1>
		<p>Today was a class work day for the multimedia remix project.  We met in class and our classmate and group mate dom was not present but he never comes to class.  He is easy to get a hold of and meet up with though luckily.  If he wasn’t we would probably have kicked him from the group.  In class we research the topic and discussed our video design.  We want to entertain and inform so it is crucial to have a well-constructed video.  Dom is an advertising major and because of this fact he knows the most about the topic out of all of us.  Talking to dom is the best resource that we have and that is nice because sometimes just researching online is annoying.  Especially when the main focus of the project is not the research itself but the overall topic and the video included.  Luckily the project is also based off of a paper that has already been completed in class so there are some building blocks to work with.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 13</h1>
		<p>Work for the multimedia remix project has continued.  The multimedia remix project is going well.  Information is compiled and plans to record, edit, and complete the video are in effect.  Meeting at the library is an effective strategy as we can all get together to discuss, brainstorm, and execute.  Video recording is tough.  When one is behind a camera it is hard not to be shy, escpecially when working with complete strangers.  It is hard not to laugh and get embarrassed once the camera starts rolling.  I am sure that we will get past this silliness and the project may be completed, or maybe we will just have a comedy, who knows.  The final retrospective project was presented to us in class.  We will write an essay covering the topics covered in class and we will also complete a class website.  A class website?  It seems really hard to work as a class to complete a website we know nothing about and have no class time to work together on.  Class has been cancelled on multiple occasions as it is.  Working online makes sense as this is a hybrid class so part is online and part is in normal class but coordinating thirty odd strangers over one website with no class time seems a little over the top.  I wish ourselves luck and this wra class is way more than what I expected.</p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 14</h1>
		<p>The multimedia remix project was due.  Wow it has seemed like a long time since that was assigned and now the year is almost over.  Time flies.  Meeting at the library helped a lot.  Trepidations about the project not having a sufficient length have all fallen by the wayside as we ended up editing out sequences of our video to make way for more important ones.  The video is plenty long and all aspects that we wished to be included int it are included.  It is going to be a great video.  I may even show my kids one day, if I have any, hopefully I will.  The creativity involved in this project was cool but, I still don’t like videos so I wish it was something that we could have chosen.   I love music.  Maybe a musical trans mediation would have aided in tickling my fancy more.  Working together was cool because I was able to meet some new people from class.  Meeting Laura, zack, and dom was a pleasure.  I was really happy with my group and we all worked really well together.  During this week we also did the final retrospective rough draft.  The rough draft was due in class along with the video.  Because the video was being completed at the same time the draft was to be done, it was tough to make a very good draft.  I wasn’t happy with my draft and it won’t be helpful to completing my final copy but I got some ideas down in Microsoft word so it is something.  I plan to describe the major assignments in the course and their over arching themes. I will include how I picked up on these themes and what they have done for me.  I will describe my final feelings and how the course has aided me in developing as a writer.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 15</h1>
		<p>Finally the last week of this course!  The final retrospective project is still being worked on.   I, and many others like me, am confused about how to go about the group aspect of this final project.  It seems that one group assignment for a wra class is enough.  I am in the formal research group and I hope we can organize enough to get some stuff done for the webmasters to put up on the website.  The paper part is easy.  I will describe all of the major assignments that we completed in the class.  Through describing the assignments I will analyze their purpose and effectiveness to me as a student.  I will use this information to review and edit my past assignments to improve them.  Hopefully through this process I will have a great portfolio with a broad range of fine-tuned written projects.  My last concern is for the groups that must work together to get the web up and running.  Its hard to organize so many people with no class time.   </p>
