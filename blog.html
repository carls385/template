	        <p>After viewing the video presented on Youtube it can be inferred that the purpose was to explain to the audience the life stories of the author of his uncle and that the struggle they both experienced can have different outcomes.  The uncle of the author was a homosexual who eventually committed suicide to because he was rejected by his family.  The author is in the same position as his uncle was before him but, he wants to explain to the audience, possibly people in the very same position as well, that it is possible to thrive because things do get better.  The video attempts this by sharing the tragic story of the uncle and his demise and contrasting it with a heartfelt letter that the author wrote to his deceased uncle.  The letter accomplishes it goal by explaining the struggle faced, the ways to overcome challenges, an optimistic view that things will get better, and the negative impact on the world left behind when committing suicide.  The message is a personal narrative in the form of a letter.  This structure is very similar to what the upcoming project is supposed to be so this will be very helpful when completing the project.  It shows how personal content is necessary including opinions and anecdotes.  I now know that these things must be included in my project.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 2</h1>
		<p>In the video viewed on line of an episode of the television show South Park, the young characters are seen abandoning all normal life aspects including the use of bathrooms, socialization, going outdoors, and eating regular meals to play an online videogame.  The video seems to be aimed towards a group of people that includes the obese, the young, and anyone involved with online gaming.  The social issue at hand may be the impact that technology, videogames in specific, has on society.  The video portrays how videogames may affect the youth.   The issue may be the way that technology has made society less social in traditional ways because socialization online can replace regular face-to-face interaction.  Videogames may also cause a withdrawal from the outside world, a decrease in physical activity, and introduce a poorer diet.  The creators obviously believe that videogames are causing these adverse effects to the players.  The games can be enjoyed in moderation but, should not consume oneâ€™s life and normal human habits should be maintained as the games are not reality. </p>
