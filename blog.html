		<p>In the video viewed on line of an episode of the television show South Park, the young characters are seen abandoning all normal life aspects including the use of bathrooms, socialization, going outdoors, and eating regular meals to play an online videogame.  The video seems to be aimed towards a group of people that includes the obese, the young, and anyone involved with online gaming.  The social issue at hand may be the impact that technology, videogames in specific, has on society.  The video portrays how videogames may affect the youth.   The issue may be the way that technology has made society less social in traditional ways because socialization online can replace regular face-to-face interaction.  Videogames may also cause a withdrawal from the outside world, a decrease in physical activity, and introduce a poorer diet.  The creators obviously believe that videogames are causing these adverse effects to the players.  The games can be enjoyed in moderation but, should not consume oneâ€™s life and normal human habits should be maintained as the games are not reality. </p>
