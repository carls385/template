			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>	Quentin Tarantino and his film Django Unchained winning two Academy Awards was a major triumph in his career but, this event has had a major controversial impact on society.  His movie glamorizes the use of violence by its main protagonist.  It depicts a hero using guns and violence to save his wife and causes the viewer to believe that these things are okay to do.  The intense scenes of gore and brutality desensitize many to themes that should be viewed as horrid and offensive.  As these themes become more main stream it is evident that such acts that are seen in the film may be acted out by members of society.  Such a violent film has had influence on events of intense violence and crime across the nation.  Children may be prone to acting out in unacceptable ways as they are exposed to violent themes in their developmental stages.  The movie also caused many to be offended by its racial content and depiction of slavery.  The film offends both whites and blacks as it depicts slaves being wrongfully treated and slave owners being murdered.  This has caused tension between the two racial groups that has not been felt in a very long time.  Increasing the censorship by major movie producing companies can help combat films such as Django from being released.  When less controversial and violent movies are being released it is hoped that there will be a decrease in violent crime and racial tension in todayâ€™s society. </p>
