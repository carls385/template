			<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
			<p>WRA 110 offered here at Michigan State University consists of five integral projects, including this one.  The five projects are designed to teach students, through means of experience, how to use writing to reflect, narrate, research, and communicate.  The projects also allow students to engage in reading and research to inquire, form opinions, and analyze, and share through rhetoric.  Reading in this course improves writing and demonstrates a way to analyze, invent, and arrange texts.  To create the projects it was necessary to research, write, read, and communicate.  All of the skills are very necessary to be successful in upper level education. The first project of the course is a personal narrative.  Being a narrative, this project is open to a variety of tones and allowed me to warm up my writing in a non-formal setting.  This project required little research since it is a personal narration of experience as a student studying a major here at MSU.  The next project that was conducted in this class was called the Cultural Analysis project.  Using a cultural artifact such as a television show, music video or movie.  This project required some research and the formation and support of an opinion.  The Formal Research project requires extensive research and information must be presented to the audience in a formal manner.  The multimedia project was very unlike all the others because I was tasked with trans-mediating a past paper.  The course retrospective develops skills in reflection, analysis, review, invention, and arrangement.  Reflecting over past assignments and analyzing the way in which they affected learning in writing, research, communication, reading, and analyzing.  
	The lived experience was the first major project assigned in this WRA class.  The assignment for this project was to narrate a story about a piece of technology from life that has impacted life in such a way that a decision was made as to which major will be studied here at Michigan State University.  Narrated in the lived experience was the story of the computer and how it affected the decision to study engineering.  Starting the narration was the biggest problem because writing a narrative was a foreign idea at the time.  Luckily, Dr. Daniels developed an assignment to assist in discovering how to write a narrative.  An in-class activity was introduced which shared the story of a young man and his struggle with homosexuality in the modern world.  The YouTube video was a personal narrative narrated by the man and after viewing the video, what it takes to create a personal narrative was evident.  A narrative is personal, emotive, and tells the story of some aspect of a life or experience.  Narratives are not required to be formal and should be accessible to multiple audiences and easy for them to understand.  Although, being an informal presentation of a personal story, narratives have a broad range of creativity, like the YouTube video seen in class.   I evaluated and analyzed the strategies that the man used in the video to write my own narrative.  The narrative includes discussion of the computer and its many capabilities and how that has led to the decision of being an engineer.  The computer itself is an effective example of engineering, whether it is the design, the code, the page, or the calculations and research being conducted.  The computer is an amazing tool for engineers and many other inhabitants of our planet.  The rhetoric approach for this project included a lot of pathos.  Aiming to appeal to the audience’s attention helped to develop an emotional connection and create a better draw for attention.  By doing this, the personal narrative accomplished its goal and created an entertaining piece for the audience to read.
	The following project in WRA was a cultural analysis.  The cultural analysis called for the elaboration of a social artifact and the effect that the artifact has on society.  The artifact included anything from songs to books.  Concentrating on popular culture artifacts could be very helpful.  The item selected for this project was the major motion picture Django Unchained and the impact that it has on violence and society.  The project focused on the overall impact of films, videogames, and music that contribute violent ideas to society.  The cultural analysis requires the writer to take a stand and present their opinion and research.  Discussing culture and society can be a very intense topic and tensions run high.  Avoiding biases and inaccuracies is very important.  To avoid such things it was necessary to have a broad range of research that caters to all sides of arguments.  The writer must also avoid using bias opinions and stick solely to accurate and relevant research.  At times, ideas were expressed that would support whether violence in film, like the intense violence seen in the movie Django Unchained , did or did not influence violent acts in society.  The ideas were always presented with points and counter points to ensure that the analysis was complete and unbiased.  Professor Daniels again provided the class with a sample such a cultural stand in the form of a South Park cartoon.  The cartoon used its humor and crassness to reveal a relevant social issue and also take a stand.  By portraying the issue in a very sarcastic and unappealing way, their view was clear.  Conclusions were drawn from the video that aided in creating the cultural analysis project.  The purpose was clearly presented, as were the position, issue, and facts.  All aspects were included in the cultural analysis project.
	The formal research project was an assignment utilizing research, rhetoric, arrangement, and delivery.  The project was intended to discuss an academic discipline at Michigan State University and its use of reading, writing, and research.  This project was a major development for writing and research.  It required extensive arrangement and delivery because I needed to develop an effective way to share the information collected through research.  An interview was also required to complete the research aspect of it.  The length of the paper, research required, and analysis caused me to expand greatly as a writer.  The research required a scholarly and trade article, expanding research technologies and revealing that sources may be very different in their credibility, accessibility, and overall effectiveness.  The interview was something unlike anything I have ever done for research and turned out to be a very useful artifact for gathering facts and research.  The project was an excellent junction of the course expectations because it combined research, reading, writing, and academic discussion.  
	After greatly expanding the horizons of my personal writing experience and technique, the multimedia remix project took it farther.  The multimedia remix project required the use of group interaction and transferring a previous paper into an entirely different mode of presentation, both aspects that are foreign to a class dedicated to the development of writing.  Even though the aspects of the multimedia project seem strange for writing development, they inevitably created more well-rounded writing.  The purpose of transferring a previous project to a new medium was to increase its effectiveness and, for our group, this also increased its accessibility.  By creating a documentary from a previous research paper, the paper is much easier for an audience to view, more entertaining, descript, and it is briefer.  A video’s use of image, sound, and text brought about many of these aspects but, in order to do that, the video had to be created methodically.  Though working as a group on a single collaborative project can get a little bit hairy at times, the task was completed by creating an effective video.  The greatest aspect of creating an effective video is the use of visuals.  As a group visuals were chosen to be presented using a balance, being consistent with grouping and information alignment.  The writing from an already effective report also had to be enhanced, meaning that the group had to make choices based on what would aid in moving the words from a page into a picture and how this would improve them.  Advertising was the topic presented in the report and documentary so many ads were viewed to pull information and analyze it to find ways to format the documentary.  Since the documentary was created to present what advertising is to an audience, the documentary itself was virtually an ad for advertising.  With this being said, viewing ads was exceptionally useful.
	The final project required in WRA 110 is this paper, a retrospective writing of the course that describes the major projects and themes learned throughout the course.  This paper includes a revision of the previous works completed throughout the duration of WRA and substantial points.  To accomplish this task, it was necessary to go back and read the previous projects and pull rights and wrongs from them and analyze their over-arching themes.  Through reading and reflecting many decisions were made as to how to structure reports, improve the projects, how writing, reading, and research tie into the course, and exercise arrangement and revision.
