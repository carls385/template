		<h1>Advertising: A World Enterprise Remix Memo</h1>

<p>MULTIMODIAL REMIX REVIEW</p>

		<p>
Unlike the other assignments in WRA 110, the Multimodal Remix required students to work in groups to reconstruct a work into a completely different mode to enhance its purpose, accessibility, and effectiveness.  Working in groups to create a work that was not simply a report or narrative provided an environment for the group become more creative and collaborate to trans-mediate a prior piece.  The creativity and collaboration took hard work and thought and the trans-mediation was not purposeless.  Explaining the collaboration, research, design choices and reasons behind the complete video is necessary to amplify the functionality and its purpose
</p>
<p>Composing in Context</p>
<p>Choosing to create a documentary to describe Advertisement as a major here at Michigan State University called for a different type of composition that was unlike an ordinary documentary.  Informing the audience about a major in the form of a documentary required us to create something that was not just a bland presentation of facts but, was more or less, an advertisement of the major.  To prevent the video from being too boring, a combination of music, slides, example ads, interviews, and facts were used.  Composing the video itself called for a deeper research of the topic to thoroughly present it to an audience.  Using the research found to apply to the film caused research to be specific and informative.  The further research and input of it into format allowed for greater learning and reiteration of advertising for my group mates and me.  Working with three other individuals does not result in quick and easy work.  Problems arose in organization, collaboration, and negotiation.  The primary plan for the documentary included an introduction of the video followed by a whole advertisement.  The ad would then be broken down, explaining what methods went where in the ad and why it included certain elements.  This plan, originally thought up by one group member, did not agree with the others due to time constraints and the lack of information it would provide.  Negotiation was used to settle on a structure including slides of facts about the major itself, techniques ads use, and examples of these techniques.  One member studies advertisement and it was agreed to conduct an interview with him to teach the audience about the major.  </p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>The first time we met as a group we shared ideas about what to do.  Dom, one group member, is studying advertisement and therefore he had written a formal report about that major.  The rest of the group and I agreed that we would like to further investigate major and by creating a documentary about that, we did learn a lot.  We also agreed that since we did not know a lot about advertising before the video, a lot of other students may be uninformed as well, meaning that we would have a large audience.  The most challenging parts, individually and as a group, was creating the narrations and conducting the interview. Since none of us have had any sort of experience with film or acting, it was very difficult to conduct an interview in which we were speaking in front of the camera.  The mood was goofy and it was hard to keep straight faces once the camera started rolling.  Lines were missed, jumbled, or forgotten, and random bouts of laughter would break out while filming.  The same would happen due to the narration.  To help overcome these problems we just had to record parts over and over again, while some of the group left the room to make the environment friendlier.  Our group worked smart to complete each part and maintain equal participation.  Zack and Dom conducted an interview, creating the questions and answers script and then playing it out on camera while Laura and I wrote a narration script for the rest of the video.  As the interview uploaded Laura and I recorded narrations.  After all parts were ready to be added, Zack edited them into the video properly and we put in the final touches.  </p>
<p>Research </p>
<p>The resources found to be the most useful were advertisements themselves.  By watching ads and deciphering their schemes, we presented a lot of comprehensive information to the audience.  Another valuable source used was our group member Dom.  As a student of advertising himself, he was able to provide a multitude of facts about the topic.  No source used was unbeneficial to the production. </p>
<p>Collaboration</p>
<p>The group work was very conducive to the production of the video.  Group members were easy to communicate with using cell phones and meeting times were planned with everyone arriving punctually.  When group meetings were not scheduled, work was collaborated using a Google document.  Having multiple members to complete the assignment brought a great deal of skill sets that were helpful.  Zack was able to provide his computer and video editing software and Dom could share his broad knowledge of the subject.  </p>
<p>Project Management</p>
<p>The planning was thought out and executed effectively.   Research was first conducted and gathered on a google doc.  Then Zack and Dom conducted an interview, creating the questions and answers script and then playing it out on camera while Laura and I wrote a narration script for the rest of the video.  As the interview uploaded Laura and I recorded narrations.  After all parts were ready to be added, Zack edited them into the video properly and we put in the final touches.  Looking back, this is nothing that I would change about the process; it was quick, easy, and productive.  </p>
<p>Documentary Design</p>
<p>Design decisions were all made to maximize the effectiveness of information being presented to an audience.  Sections are introduced with plain text on a slide and this was decided to be informative of what is to come in the video and able to capture attention but not distract.   Slides with colors in the schemes are presented in the color so the audience has auditory and visual stimulation of the fact being presented.  Company logos are also displayed to give the viewer recognizable examples.  With familiar signs and ads, the viewer is able to relate what knowledge they already have with new facts.  An interview was conducted with the intent that it was the most effective way to validly present facts in an entertaining and realistic way.
