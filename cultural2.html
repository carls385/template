			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>As technology advances more and more everyday it begins to play an even larger role in normal human life.  Technology has allowed man to achieve unimaginable feats from improvements in medicine like prosthetic limbs to environmentally friendly automobiles.  There are also much less important roles that technology is beginning to play.  With the development of the very first video recording camera, entertainment has found itself using technology as a medium for people to explore.  Cinema is an excellent gateway into imagination and creativity for people of all ages and it is becoming an even larger industry as computer animation, cameras, and video playing devices continue to evolve.  As technology evolves it has also become a trend for the art of cinema to change as well.  Some movies today are being made with a lesser goal to entertain and instead, shock.  Movies have become increasingly graphic, violent, and realistic.  Improvements in the key technological components of cinema have allowed film makers to create extremely graphic movies and as society becomes more and more comfortable with these themes the movies are allowed to get worse.  People of all ages are exposed to these films and they may be having an adverse effect on society.  With gratuitous violence becoming the mainstream, it is becoming extremely influential on the viewer and society as a whole.  This may be causing an increase in crime and violence in society.</p>
