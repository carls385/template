			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Django Unchained tells the story of an African American slave that is freed by a white American bounty hunter in the Lincoln Era United States.  The two go on a spree of killing wanted criminals and collecting the bounty for each of them.  One major aspect that makes this movie so graphically controversial is the directorâ€™s lack of adhesion to ordinary cinema etiquette.  In most mainstream movies, that include violence, scene of killing are shot in such a way that a viewer understands what has happened but is not fully subject to the graphic nature.  Quentin Tarantino created the film in such a way that, instead of the camera panning away from a brutal scene allowing it to unfold behind the scenes, it concentrates on the scene, causing each action to have a stunningly realistic feel.  The director used this method to create a sense of shock to the movie industry and the viewer but, it is creating very adverse effects that extend beyond the cinematic world and into the real world.  As the film centers on the violence it also uses a comedic approach to change the mood and setting.  With violent scenes being meshed with comedy and laughter, the film creates an almost sick and sadistic being in the viewer.  It is glamorizing guns, killing, and fighting in a way that has rarely been seen before.  A large issue with the film is that the main character, Django, is portrayed as a hero as he marches across the United States shooting white men and slave owners to free his indentured wife.  It is wrong that a hero would use such violent acts to achieve his role and this causes a glamorization of the violence in the film.  What he is doing is seen as good even though the acts the self are truly grotesque.</p>
<p>Being intensively violent is not the only impact that this film plays on society.  The movie also includes a racial controversy that may be fueling tension amongst certain groups of Americans.  The movie has a cast of actors that are the accurate race for their role in the film and due to the directors intentional attempt at depicting slavery in an extremely honest way, it creates controversy.  There are intense scenes of violence where white Americans are brutally treating African slaves and the director uses his main character, Django, to kill these white Americans in a cathartic way for the slaves.  The African American character killing white men in America is like a reversion of an issue already solved by the United States and its people.
